# Snakes-or-No-Snakes

This repository contains the code needed to reproduce the "Snake or no Snakes" Stat 482 Capstone project. In particular the models and results are contained within the notebooks. Note the data itself is far to large for this repo and is stored elsewhere. 

File descriptions:

* models: This is the main notebook which contains the final logistic regression and CNN models. 

* models_od_1cam notebook: This notebook is for the third analysis task - testing generalizability by holding out one camera.

* models_log_adjusted: This notebook explores logistic regression approaches.

* data_exploration: This notebook has code for data exploration and viewing loaded images. 

* For interactive Java quiz with selected image, see Quiz.
